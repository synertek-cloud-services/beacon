# Beacon — Project Log

## Session: 2026-07-10 / 2026-07-12

### What was completed

**Two-tier monitoring policy system (full stack)**
- Migrations `0010_policies.sql` + `0011_default_policies.sql` — replaced flat `alert_definitions` with `policies` / `policy_monitors` / `alert_state` tables
- Worker: `worker/src/routes/admin/policies.ts` — full CRUD for policies and nested monitors; `GET /policies` embeds monitors in response
- Worker: `worker/src/lib/alerts.ts` — rewrote to resolve effective monitors per device (company scope wins over global), evaluate `sustained_minutes` via `condition_first_seen` timestamp, handle `auto_resolve_after_minutes`
- Added `av_status` check type; AV monitor key is `av_status:${av_state}` to allow multiple AV monitors per policy
- Seeded 3 default global policies: Antivirus Health, Disk Space, Device Offline

**Dashboard — GlobalPoliciesPage redesign**
- Replaced card/accordion with NinjaRMM-style table: Name, Targets, Scope, Monitors count, Created, Enabled toggle
- Row click expands inline monitor detail panel (read-only; manage monitors via Edit Policy page)
- Toolbar: row count, Edit (1 selected → navigate to edit page), Delete, Override (clone to company scope)
- Expand state: `reactive<Record<string, boolean>>` — required because `ref<Set>` has subtle Vue 3 reactivity edge cases
- Override modal: clones selected global policies to a target company via `clone_from` POST param

**Dashboard — PolicyFormPage (new)**
- Full dedicated page at `/global/policies/new` and `/global/policies/:id`
- Matches Datto RMM create-policy UX: breadcrumb nav, back button, form sections (Name, Description, Scope, Monitors, Targets, Enabled)
- Add Monitor: right-side drawer panel (620px) with 3 sections — Monitor Type (clickable type cards with SVG icons), Alert (type-specific config + period + priority + auto-resolve), Response (webhook toggle)
- New policies: monitors accumulate locally, all POSTed on Save
- Edit policies: monitor changes hit API immediately; policy field changes deferred to Save

**Dashboard — Sidebar improvements**
- Resizable: drag handle on right edge, width persisted to `localStorage` (`beacon-sidebar-w`)
- Collapsible: hamburger button in topbar, persisted to `localStorage` (`beacon-sidebar-collapsed`)
- Active client block: appears inside Companies section when a company is selected, shows company name + Devices sub-link, persists across navigation, cleared with × button
- Sidebar gets `z-index: 600` so it stays above any fixed page overlays (drawers, etc.)
- Company list removed from sidebar — replaced by active-client block

**Dashboard — DevicesPage fix**
- "Filtered by company" now resolves company name from the tenants list instead of device records, so it works even when a company has zero enrolled devices

### Key technical decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `reactive<Record<string, boolean>>` for expand state | `ref<Set>` mutations aren't reliably tracked by Vue 3's dependency system when the Set is replaced |
| Monitors embedded in policy list response | Avoids N+1 queries; `GET /policies` always returns monitors in the same payload |
| `av_status:${av_state}` as scope-resolution map key | Allows all three AV states to coexist as separate monitors on one policy |
| `condition_first_seen` timestamp for sustained_minutes | Time-based debounce is more reliable than failure-count-based; survives agent restarts |
| Full-page form for Create/Edit policy | Matches Datto RMM UX; allows complex monitor management without modal nesting |
| Right-side drawer for Add Monitor | Keeps sidebar visible; doesn't feel like full navigation change |
| Sidebar `z-index: 600` | Ensures sidebar always sits above any `position: fixed` content overlays from page components |

### Next logical steps

1. **Test full policy alert evaluation end-to-end** — enroll a real agent, trigger a CPU/disk/offline condition, confirm `alert_state` row transitions from `condition_first_seen` → `is_alerting = 1` after `sustained_minutes`; verify webhook fires; verify auto-resolve after `auto_resolve_after_minutes`.

2. **Alert detail / device alert view** — currently `GlobalAlertsPage` lists all active alerts globally. Add a per-device alert tab on the device detail view so techs can see active alerts for a specific endpoint without leaving its context.

3. **Policy assignment feedback on devices** — show which policies are currently active for a device (the effective monitors resolved for that device's OS + class + tenant). This helps techs understand why a device is or isn't alerting. Would live on the device detail page as a "Monitoring" tab.
